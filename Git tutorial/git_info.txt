Git workflow
Initialize/Create git repository: which git will start been able to tell what file changed and what file added
    git init:  Initiazation open access to all the git command listed below
    git status : shows which branch we are in, show recent commit message and what is there to commit.
    git add : allow recently changed/created file to stagging area.
               eg: git add <list of files>
    git rm --cached <file>... to exclude file added to be included in next commit.
    git commit -m "message which give description about the commit." each has commit code which can be used while roleback.
    git remote add origin <git repository location which can be https/ssh use https>
      eg:  git remote add origin <https://github.com/Shafin-Thiyam/rest_flask_python.git>
    git push will push all the commited file to remote repo.
        If we have not set up master repo push will fail. following command will resolve the issue.
            git push --set-upstream origin master
        it will ask for user name and password of git account.
    git pull will get latest version of the code from gir server

SSH key: is way of encrypting info it generate public key(for decrypt) and private key(for encrytpt)
    ssh-keygen : it will generate public and private key pair.
                need to enter file which we use to save key.
                It will ask for pass phrase its optional
                now we can share the public key and way to do that:
                    Go to the location of where public/private key is saved
                    open file <file-Location>/id_rsa.pub and copy all of it.
                    go to github account -> profile ->edit profile ->SSH and GPG key -> new ssh key ->
                        add title and paste copied text in key -> add ssh key
     git remote remove origin
     git remote add origin <ssh version of repo> this will never ask for password if the system is the same system from which public key is generated.

     Readme file give description the repository.
        use markedown which is same as jupyter notebook syntex. Eg ## for heading ** for bold etc...

        proper read me file has:
        ## Heading: project title
        **Installation: dependancy details**
        **Description:** detail of the project and your contact detail helpfull for the jobs.
        **Implementation:** How it was implemented  for what purpose.
